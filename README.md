# Grant Matcher
## Introduction
*Grant Matcher* is an app built for university staff members who want to better support their university's researchers. *Grant Matcher* provides a neat and organised system to store data for researchers and grant opportunities, allowing users to find all eligible researchers for a certain grant opportunity. This will help diversify the grant opportunities your researchers apply for.

While currently only intended for staff of the University of Sydney (USYD), if you are interested, you can contact me directly at flyingbutter213@gmail.com and I will provide you with a separate database.

## Legal Notice
*Grant Matcher* values the privacy of our users. We store your data in a secure PostgreSQL database and we only store what is necessary. Before adding any researcher's data to *Grant Matcher*, please ensure you have the researcher's consent to store the data related to their researcher. *Grant Matcher* has excellent security features that ensure that only USYD staff members have access to this data.
